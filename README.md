# insect-leaf-predation-dataset

The Insect Leaf Predation Dataset results from applying leaf damage simulation caused by different insects in healthy soybean leaf images. The dataset contains five classes. One class represents intact leaf samples, and the other four classes include images damaged by caterpillars, gastropods, grasshoppers, and green cows. The defoliation rate is equally distributed, ranging from 1.01% to 29.99%, with an average of 15.04%. The damage per leaf sample ranged from 1 to more than 50 compromised areas, and the similarity between any two images ranges from 0.3% to 68.1%, with an average of 17.91%.
